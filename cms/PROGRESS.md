# Custom CMS Implementation Progress

## ✅ Phase 1: Foundation Setup (COMPLETED)

### What We've Built

#### 🏗️ Project Structure
- Created separate `cms/` folder to preserve existing Strapi backend
- Organized code into logical folders: `prisma/`, `lib/`, `types/`, `api/`
- Maintained original `backend/` folder as fallback option

#### 🗄️ Database Schema (Prisma + PostgreSQL)
- **Users table**: Admin authentication with roles
- **Pages table**: Replaces Strapi pages with JSON fields for flexibility
- **Car Series table**: Replaces Strapi car series with specifications
- **Navigation Items table**: Hierarchical menu management
- **Media table**: Image and file management
- **Content Blocks table**: Flexible page building system

#### 📝 TypeScript Definitions
- Complete type definitions for all data structures
- Form validation types
- API response types
- Navigation hierarchy types
- Content block types

#### ✅ Validation System (Zod)
- Input validation for all CRUD operations
- Type-safe form handling
- API request/response validation
- Search and pagination schemas

#### 📚 Documentation
- Comprehensive setup guide (`SETUP.md`)
- Project overview (`README.md`)
- Progress tracking (`PROGRESS.md`)
- Clear migration strategy
