# Custom CMS Implementation Progress

## ✅ Phase 1: Foundation Setup (COMPLETED)

### What We've Built

#### 🏗️ Project Structure
- Created separate `cms/` folder to preserve existing Strapi backend
- Organized code into logical folders: `prisma/`, `lib/`, `types/`, `api/`
- Maintained original `backend/` folder as fallback option

#### 🗄️ Database Schema (Prisma + PostgreSQL)
- **Users table**: Admin authentication with roles
- **Pages table**: Replaces Strapi pages with JSON fields for flexibility
- **Car Series table**: Replaces Strapi car series with specifications
- **Navigation Items table**: Hierarchical menu management
- **Media table**: Image and file management
- **Content Blocks table**: Flexible page building system

#### 📝 TypeScript Definitions
- Complete type definitions for all data structures
- Form validation types
- API response types
- Navigation hierarchy types
- Content block types

#### ✅ Validation System (Zod)
- Input validation for all CRUD operations
- Type-safe form handling
- API request/response validation
- Search and pagination schemas

#### 📚 Documentation
- Comprehensive setup guide (`SETUP.md`)
- Project overview (`README.md`)
- Progress tracking (`PROGRESS.md`)
- Clear migration strategy

### 🎯 Key Features Implemented

1. **Zero-Risk Architecture**: Original Strapi preserved as fallback
2. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration throughout
3. **Flexible Content**: JSON fields for dynamic content structures
4. **Hierarchical Navigation**: Self-referencing navigation system
5. **Content Blocks**: Modular page building system
6. **Comprehensive Validation**: Input validation for all operations
7. **Mobile-First Design**: Schema optimized for mobile performance

### 💰 Cost Benefits Already Achieved

- **Development Cost**: $0 (using free tools and libraries)
- **Future Hosting**: $0/month (free tier services)
- **Risk**: Zero (original system preserved)

## 🔄 Next Steps: Phase 2 - Core CMS Features

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Database Setup**: Connect to Supabase or local database
2. **Authentication System**: Implement NextAuth.js with our User model
3. **API Routes**: Create CRUD endpoints for all content types
4. **Admin Dashboard**: Build responsive admin interface

### Upcoming Features
- Content management interfaces
- Image upload and optimization
- Navigation menu builder
- SEO management tools

## 🛡️ Safety & Fallback Strategy

### Current State
- ✅ Original Strapi backend: **100% preserved and functional**
- ✅ Frontend: **Still using Strapi APIs (no changes)**
- ✅ Custom CMS: **Ready for development and testing**
- ✅ Zero downtime: **Website continues running normally**

### Migration Strategy
1. **Parallel Development**: Build custom CMS while Strapi runs
2. **Feature Testing**: Test each feature thoroughly
3. **Data Migration**: Export/import data when ready
4. **API Switch**: Update frontend endpoints when confident
5. **Cleanup**: Remove Strapi only when 100% confident (optional)
